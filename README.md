# Quadcopter-Point-Mass-MPC
 This is a simple simulation of a point mass drone system using an MPC controller.
 Although both the controller and dynamics are linear, these are handled separately by the quad_controller_PM.py , and quad_dymamics_PM.py files, respectively.
 
 To run the simulation, open quad_sim_PM.py. To change or add trajectories, open quad_trajectories_pm.py
